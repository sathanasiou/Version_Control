Scope:

Repository used in order to demonstrate the importance of version control systems.

### Get the repository in your local system

In order to clone the repository in your local system --> git clone {repository-url}.

If you want to clone only a specific branch --> git clone {repository-url} -b {branch-name} 

### Change branch

To check in which branch are you and the rest of the branches as well --> git branch

To move to another branch --> git checkout {branch-name} 
                            If there is that branch simply it will move there. If not then you will get an error message.

To move to another branch and create it in the fly --> git checkout -b {branch-name}

### Check status

In order to check your local status against the online repository --> git status
